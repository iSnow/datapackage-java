The frictionless data project maintains two repositories for example data:
- https://github.com/frictionlessdata/testsuite-data. This contains test-suite data every implementation should be able to parse
- https://github.com/frictionlessdata/examples. Real-world examples of datapackages, including zipped versions.

Our test data derives mostly from the testsuite-data, with a couple zip files from examples.
